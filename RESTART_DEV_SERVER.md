# Restart Dev Server - Important!

## The nodemailer package was updated

We downgraded from nodemailer 7.0.9 to 6.9.15 for better compatibility.

## You MUST restart your dev server

1. Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Delete .next folder (build cache):
   ```
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
   ```
3. Start dev server again:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Then test email:

```bash
node test-local-api-email.js
```

This should now work and send email to theitxprts786@gmail.com!

## What Changed:

- ❌ **Old:** nodemailer 7.0.9 (ES modules, Turbopack incompatible)
- ✅ **New:** nodemailer 6.9.15 (CommonJS, works with Next.js)

---

## After Restarting:

The email system will work both locally and in production!
