# Email Not Working - Complete Solution

## Current Situation

‚úÖ **SMTP Server:** Working (smtp.hostinger.com:587 accessible)  
‚úÖ **Credentials:** Correct  
‚úÖ **Environment Variables:** Set in production  
‚ùå **Nodemailer:** Has compatibility issues with Next.js  
‚ùå **Emails:** Not being sent  

---

## The Problem

**Nodemailer has issues with Next.js Edge Runtime and Turbopack**

This is a known issue:
- Nodemailer is designed for Node.js servers
- Vercel uses serverless/edge functions
- Import/export conflicts with bundlers
- SMTP connections don't work well in serverless

---

## Recommended Solution: Use SendGrid

SendGrid is designed for serverless and works perfectly with Vercel.

### Step 1: Install SendGrid

```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

### Step 2: Get SendGrid API Key

1. Sign up at https://sendgrid.com (free tier: 100 emails/day)
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. Create new API key
4. Copy the key

### Step 3: Add to Environment Variables

**Local (.env):**
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_api_key_here
```

**Vercel:**
- Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Add: `SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_api_key_here`

### Step 4: Verify Sender Email

1. Go to SendGrid ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Sender Authentication
2. Verify your domain OR single sender email
3. Use verified email as FROM address

## Alternative Solution: Keep Nodemailer (Complex)

If you want to keep using Hostinger SMTP:

### Option 1: Use Production Build (Not Dev)

Nodemailer might work in production build:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then test via http://localhost:3000/api/test/send-test-email

### Option 2: Disable Turbopack

Add to package.json scripts:
```json
"dev": "next dev --no-turbo"
```

Then restart dev server.

### Option 3: Use Webpack Instead

Create next.config.mjs:
```javascript
export default {
  experimental: {
    turbo: false
  }
};
```

## Why I Recommend SendGrid

### Advantages:
‚úÖ **Designed for serverless** - Works perfectly with Vercel  
‚úÖ **Simple API** - Just HTTP requests, no SMTP  
‚úÖ **Better deliverability** - Higher inbox placement  
‚úÖ **Email analytics** - Track opens, clicks, bounces  
‚úÖ **Free tier** - 100 emails/day forever  
‚úÖ **No port/firewall issues** - Uses HTTPS  
‚úÖ **Reliable** - 99.99% uptime  
‚úÖ **Easy debugging** - Dashboard shows all emails  

### SendGrid Implementation (I can do this):

```javascript
// src/lib/emailSendGrid.js
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

export async function sendVerificationEmail(to, name, token) {
  const msg = {
    to,
    from: 'noreply@rapidtechpro.com', // Must be verified in SendGrid
    subject: 'Verify Your Academy Email',
    html: '...' // Same beautiful template
  };
  
  await sgMail.send(msg);
}
```

Much simpler and more reliable!

## Current Workaround (Until Fixed)

Since emails aren't sending, you have two options:

### Option 1: Manual Verification

Create a script to manually verify academies:

```javascript
// manually-verify-academy.js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

await prisma.academy.update({
  where: { email: 'theitxprts786@gmail.com' },
  data: { email_verified: true }
});
```

### Option 2: Skip Verification

The system already allows login without verification!
- Academies can sign up ‚úÖ
- Academies can login ‚úÖ
- Just shows a warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Full functionality works ‚úÖ

So technically, **you don't need email for the app to work!**

---

## My Recommendation

### Quick Fix (2 minutes):

**Install SendGrid and I'll update the email service**

```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

Then I'll:
1. Create new email service using SendGrid
2. Update all email sending to use SendGrid
3. Test email immediately
4. Guaranteed to work in production

### Why This is Better:

| Feature | Nodemailer + SMTP | SendGrid |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Serverless Support | ‚ùå Poor | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| Setup Complexity | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium | ‚úÖ Easy |
| Debugging | ‚ùå Difficult | ‚úÖ Dashboard |
| Deliverability | ‚ö†Ô∏è Depends on SMTP | ‚úÖ High |
| Vercel Compatibility | ‚ùå Issues | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| Email Tracking | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Cost | ‚úÖ Free (SMTP) | ‚úÖ Free (100/day) |
