   - Hashes the password
   - Associates with academy if provided

2. **Player Profile Creation:**
   - Creates a new player profile in the `PlayerProfiles` table
   - Links to the created user
   - Stores physical attributes and position data

3. **Authentication:**
   - Generates JWT token for immediate login
   - Returns user and profile information
